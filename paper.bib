  abstract    = "The value of any kind of data is greatly enhanced when it
                 exists in a form that allows it to be integrated with other
                 data. One approach to integration is through the annotation of
                 multiple bodies of data using common controlled vocabularies
                 or 'ontologies'. Unfortunately, the very success of this
                 approach has led to a proliferation of ontologies, which
                 itself creates obstacles to integration. The Open Biomedical
                 Ontologies (OBO) consortium is pursuing a strategy to overcome
                 this problem. Existing OBO ontologies, including the Gene
                 Ontology, are undergoing coordinated reform, and new
                 ontologies are being created on the basis of an evolving set
                 of shared principles governing ontology development. The
                 result is an expanding family of ontologies designed to be
                 interoperable and logically well formed and to incorporate
                 accurate representations of biological reality. We describe
                 this OBO Foundry initiative and provide guidelines for those
                 who might wish to become involved.",
